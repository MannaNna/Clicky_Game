# Clicky-Game (React.js)

### About

* `CLICKY-GAME` is a memory game built with `React.js`. The application is component based, able to keeps track of change events using `state`, and updates to the page render dynamically and without page refresh. 
    The goal of the game is simple, using your mouse, `CLICK` each of the twelve `Family guy` character cards in whatever order you chose - the order does not matter, only that you do not click the same card twice!  

<h2>About the Code</h2>
<h4>Getting Started</h4>
<p>First thing I did was create the React Client-side boilerplate by typing create-react-app clicky-game in the command line.  Next, I changed into that directory by typing 'cd clicky-game' in the terminal. After that I typed yarn start to open the app in the browser.</p>
<h4>Starting to Code</h4>
<p>Create-react-app gives you a public folder with a basic index.html page, some basic css for the react template, an App.js file, index.js file, and some other boilerplate files.  I only had to alter two things in the index.html page: the title of my app and include a Bootstrap CDN link. I either altered or completely changed the rest of the files, adding my own style.  The bulk of the code for this app was done in the src/components directory.  I decided to make three total components for my app, however, it could have been made with much more or probably less.</p>
<h4>Components</h4>
<ul>
  <li>FamilyCard
      <p>The card component is where the family characters images are displayed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Title
  </li>
  <li>Wrapper
  </li>
</ul>
